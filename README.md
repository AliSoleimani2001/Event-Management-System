# Event-Management-System
This document provides a concise overview of a  programming and database design project conducted as part of the  advanced programming course at Shahid Beheshti University.
In this project, our team aimed to build and design a website 
for an event management system using the Django framework. 
Django, a high-level Python web framework, comes with an 
SQLite3 database engine. In order to make this project more 
efficient and scalable, other structured query languages could 
have been considered and implemented, but for simplicity 
limited resources we used Django frame works default setting.
